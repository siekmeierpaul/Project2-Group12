              <p class="text-center bg-secondary text-white">Michelin stars are now considered a hallmark of fine dining by many of the world’s top chefs — not to mention restaurant patrons. The stars are not easy to obtain and are awarded to the best restaurants in each particular city in the guide. Star recipients gain immense prestige and exposure along with the honor, and many restaurant owners also see an increase in business after receiving Michelin stars (while some who lost stars have experienced the opposite).</p>
              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item bg-secondary text-white">One star: The restaurant is considered very good in its category but is limited in some way. This restaurant has a quality menu and prepares cuisine to a consistently high standard, but it may lack a unique element that would bring people back over and over again.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-secondary text-white">Two stars: The restaurant has excellent cuisine delivered in a unique way. This restaurant has something exceptional to offer and is worth a detour to visit while traveling.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-secondary text-white">Three stars: The restaurant has exceptional cuisine and is worth a special trip just to visit. Rather than being a stop on the way to a destination, this restaurant is the destination. This restaurant serves distinct dishes that are executed to perfection.</li>
